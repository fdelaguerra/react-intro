      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <h2>React test app</h2>
      <p>This project is part of an independent study where I began learning React from scratch.</p>
      <p>This project used create-react-app to get started and JSX to build out on a concept I had for a portfolio page. I used it to continue my learning from the UF Coding and Web Apps course. That course's professor at the time did not have experience with React, but mentored me as best she could throughout the process.</p>
